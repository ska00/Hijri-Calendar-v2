    Scrapes data from the website AstroPixels (URL: https://astropixels.com/ephemeris/phasescat/phasescat.html) 
    and writes to a readable csv file which is fed to the main python program to compute the Hijri (Islamic) Calendar. 
    The headers of the written csv files are (in order): datetime, phase, friendlydate, eclipse.
        datetime: the date of the moon phase
        phase: the phase of the moon on the given date
        friendlydate: the date written in a more readable format

    The eclipses are bunched into one single Hirji month, since some of the eclipse types
    do not happen during the full moon (example: the solar eclipse only happens when there is a new moon).

    Note: This code does not handle errors that may pop up such as not being able to access the website.

    Also note the following when dealing with the csv data files:
    1. The Julian calendar was in effect before October 4, 1582.
    2. 10 days were removed: October 4, 1582 preceded October 15, 1582
    3. After October 15, 1582 the Gregorian calendar was in use.

    I believe the issues have been circumvented in this code. I've used the 'convertdate' package
    to convert Julian dates to Gregorian dates so that the dates are consistent. 
    Moreover, the 'datetime' package only deals with Gregorian dates. Any Julian dates must be converted 
    to Gregorian before creating a datetime object.
